### Where to begin

1. I am making a full stack app that will allow the user to find free wifi networks in Chicago and also comment on/read other user's comments on the networks & the locations that host the network.

2. I initially started putting together this app with React & Sinatra. This was Monday, 04/03/2017
    * I knew I didn't fully understand React as the logic got deeper and modals came into play. * But I thought I could figure it out and React was freshest in my mind as we had spent the last week of class learning and using it.
    * I was very wrong. Made a complete mess of it. Became horribly confused and also horribly broke the code.

3. So on early Tuesday 04/04/2017 afternoon, I decided to scrap the React portion of the code and rewrite it.
    * Unfortunately I was so confused from the React, I then started mixing all kinds of things up in my head. I probably should have just started the whole thing from scratch, but instead tried to keep the Sinatra and graft the new client side onto the existing structure.
    * I ended writing a Frankenstein's monster of code, that was all over the place. Ruby here, jquery & ajax there, with somehow bits and pieces of Gulp, Express and god knows what else.

4. By late afternoon Wednesday/Wednesday night 04/05/2017, I realize how hopelessly lost and mixed up I am. I now have 36 hours to not only complete the app but also get it right for the first time.

5. Working 32 of the next 36 hours, it is now Friday 04/07/2017 morning at 9AM. Using Ruby and Sinatra I manage to get a very barebones structure in place and start to get things working.
    * Database is working, session is working, and when I input a user & password it is being saved to the database. However comments are very broken, and I do not have a working app. Going to have to take the incomplete and work all through the weekend to fix it.
